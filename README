CCD2ISO
-------

Wheeew... finally, after looking for quite sometime... this hack is done.

Okay... for those of you who might wonder what this utility for, CCD2ISO is a CloneCD image file to ISO image file converter. As I now move to Linux entirely, I still need some migration, specially for my existing CloneCD images, I want to use them in Linux, and I can't find any converter to convert them to ISO to be mountable by Linux, so I try to make one...

Well... this is my first Linux Project, so don't be expecting much from me... I'm trying to make NRG2ISO (Nero image to ISO) converter, but still I have some difficulty to get the .nrg file format, hopefully someone out there can help me out...

Hopefully this will be so much usefull for someone out there as much as I do...

Please feel free to give any feedback to danny@it.petra.ac.id


HOW TO USE
----------

Easy... normally you would have 3 file from CloneCD image, they are .ccd, .img, and .sub, just type:

	ccd2iso <.img filename> <.iso filename>

for example:

	ccd2iso myimage.img myimage.iso


COMPILING
---------

Just follow normal procedure:

	./configure
	make
	make install


TECHNICAL EXPLANATION
---------------------

After some strange hacking through CloneCD's image file, I found that CloneCD is only dumping CD's raw data, thus together with 12 byte synchronization and 4 byte header...

Okay... some odd things exists, I hope someone can tell me why... According to ECMA-130, mode 2 sector has 2336 bytes of data, but the ISO file only contains 2048 bytes, what are the rest of the data? As I know, there are EDC, Intermediate, P-Parity and Q-Parity, but those are for mode 1 data... ?? And again there is 8 byte skip at the beginning of dumped CloneCD image file after I strip out the headers... still don't know why...
